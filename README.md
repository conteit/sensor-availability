# sensor-availability

This is an experimental test project that I have created in order to find a way for using temperature sensor readings in order to determine if sensor is still operational (available) or not, by exploiting Apache Kafka capabilities.

The idea for the solution came from https://medium.com/@cbenaveen/high-available-task-scheduling-design-using-kafka-and-kafka-streams-dcd81121d43b.
